# FewBit Core Wallet Latest v2.2.0.0

Miners can mine right from the 100th block, so create a mining pool now and join FewBit's network.

FewBit operates on a system of self-governance, where stakeholders including stakers, token holders, Service Node operators, and others vested in the blockchain can collectively make decisions.

FewBit harnesses the capabilities of a network consisting of Service Nodes and Staking Nodes. Service Nodes provide the computational power necessary for all FewBit functions, while Staking Nodes safeguard the network through our smartnodes system.

FewBit is community-governed and operates without a centralized entity, ensuring that decisions are made by and for the community. The project sustains its development through a self-funding mechanism.
